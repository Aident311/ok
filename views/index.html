        Hooray! You've finished the <a href="/install">install guide</a> and are
        reading to start setting your bot up.
      </p>
      <h2>Add your bot to a server</h2>
      <p>
        You have to have a server to add your bot to and you have to have admin
        permissions.
        <a
          href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-"
          >If you don't have one already, here is how you make one.</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several ways to add a Discord bot to the server. For this one
        we'll use Oauth2, which allows you to use a link that authorizes your
        bot to a specific server. Read more here.
      </p>
      <div id="no-client-found">
        Oops looks like there is something wrong with your install. Check out
        the <a href="/install">Install guide to get it set up</a>
      </div>
      <div class="input" id="client-found">
        <label>Bot oauth2 URL</label>

        <div class="addon">
          <input readonly class="copyurl" id="oauth-url" type="text" value="" />
          <button onclick="clipboard('oauth-url')">Copy</button>

          <a href="" id="oauth-url-go" class="button" target="new">Go</a>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Keep your bot awake</h2>
      <div id="uptime-not-found">
        Oops looks like there is no Uptime Robot api key, you can head to the
        install guide to learn how to set it up
      </div>
      <div id="uptime-not-set-up">
        Looks like Uptime Robot hasn't been set up yet. Click to set up up a
        monitor automagically with the following recommended settings
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor type: HTTP(s)</li>
          <li>Friendly Name: <span class="domain-name-title"></span></li>

        </ul>
        <button onclick="monitorSetup()" id="uptime-robot-button">
          Create my Uptime Robot monitor!
        </button>
      </div>
      <div id="uptime-working">
        Sweet, your Uptime Robot is set up and working, it will ping your domain
        every 5 minutes to keep your Discord bot awake!

      <h2>Code your bot!</h2>
      <p>This bot is built with <a href="hhttps://github.com/brh55/botkit-discord">BotKit Discord</a>, which combines the power of <a href="https://discord.js.org/">Discord.js</a> with <a href="https://botkit.ai/">Botkit</a>. Discord.js is the most popular way to connect node.js apps (like this one!) with the Discord API. Botkit is a hugely useful framework for bot building. You can use either one build on your bot.</p>
      <p>
        We've started you off with a Botkit "skill" you can find in <em>skills/hears.js</em>. This skill is triggered someone sends a message starting with !thanks. You can find some more useful skill code in the <a href="hhttps://github.com/brh55/botkit-discord">BotKit Discord</a> Readme. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Give your bot a memory
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may notice a message saying <code>info: ** No persistent storage method specified! Data may be lost when process shuts down.</code> in the logs. This means that whatever anyone tells the bot, the bot Glitch app doesn't remember. It doesn't save any data about messages. You may want to save data, for example if you want to build a system that stores a record of people who have been thanked by the bot. 
      </p>

      <h2>Protect your bot</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some tips for keeping your bot secure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>NEVER share your Discord API token or put it anywhere else but .env</li>
        <li>Your code is public (anyone can see and copy it), unless you make your Glitch app <a href="https://glitch.com/help/privateproject/">private</a>.</li>
        <li>If you add <a href="https://glitch.com/help/how-do-i-invite-collaborators-to-edit-my-project/">collaborators</a> to your project they will be able to see your .env and copy the code. </li>
          <li>If for some reason you remove a collaborator or accidentally share your token, you should also reset your Discord API token by going to <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications">The Discord Developer portal</a>, clicking on the bot's application, heading to the "bot" section and clicking "regenerate".</li>
  
      </ul>
